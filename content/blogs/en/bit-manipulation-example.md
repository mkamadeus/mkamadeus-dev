## Background

I (in)frequently check on sites like Codeforces and Kattis to improve my programming logic and skills. One day, I stumbled upon an interesting problem to me. At first, this problem looked quite challenging, so I tried to solve it (problem will be explained in later sections). At first, I couldnâ€™t solve it â€” I couldnâ€™t find any patterns relating to the problem. I wasnâ€™t in such a rush, so I left the problem as itâ€™s already midnight.

Once I was doing nothing at the shopping mall. I went to look back at the problem, and I got an idea on how to do it - which is by using _bit manipulation_!

## What are Bitmasks?

In order to understand bit manipulation, firstly we need to understand bitmasks since it is used in bit manipulation operations.
A bit is short of _"binary digits"_ - digits which contains zeros and ones. 
An integer variable usually have a 32 bits limit, which means it consists of 32 bits with its range of $2^{32}$ (2 derived from the state of bits â€” 0 or 1 which is 2 possibilities).

Bitmasks, on the other hand, are simply integers used as a set of booleans.
Since booleans have a state of only `False` or `True`, it can also be represented by $0$ and $1$, and that is why it is called bitmasks!
Summing up:

> Bitmasks take advantage of how an integer be represented in its binary form, meaning that it can be used as a compact set of booleans.

## Bitwise Operators

Bit manipulation is a technique that is used to, well, manipulate the bits that represents an integer. 
Iâ€™m going to show you some commonly used bitwise operators in C++.
This only shows the bit operators and how it works; the usage will be shown in the example.
Itâ€™s uncommon to use it purely like in the examples (unless you work in low-level programming maybe).

## Shift Left and Shift Right (`<<` and `>>`)

This operation shifts the binary form of an integer to left/right given the value.

Note that shift left is equivalent to multiplying by 2, and shift right is dividing by 2 and rounding it. Itâ€™s generally faster than usual dividing operations altough the compiler may already compiled it to use shift operations.


```cpp
int x=5; // 101 in binary

x=5;
x=x<<1; //10 = 2 in decimal

x=5;
x=x<<3; //0 = 0 (can be seen as 0101)

x=5;
x=x>>1; //1010 = 10 in decimal

x=5;
x=x>>2; //10100 = 20 in decimal
```

### Bitwise OR (`|`)

Does OR operation on the binary form of two integers bit by bit.


```cpp
int x=5; // 101 in binary
int y=9; // 1001 in binary
int z=x|y;

/*
x = 0101
y = 1001
--------- OR
z = 1101 = 13 in decimal
*/
```

### Bitwise AND (`&`)

Does an AND operation on the binary form of two integers bit by bit.

```cpp
int x=5; // 101 in binary
int y=9; // 1001 in binary
int z=x&y;

/*
x = 0101
y = 1001
--------- AND
z = 0001 = 1 in decimal
*/
```

### Bitwise NOT (`~`)

This operator inverts the bits of the binary form of an integer.
This operation is usually used in conjunction of other operators; for example to make an NAND or NOR operations.

> No examples provided here since it depends on the data type.

### Bitwise XOR (`^`)

Applies the XOR operation of the binary form of two integers bit by bit.
Useful to toggle bits; see example below.

```cpp
int x=5; // 101 in binary
int y=9; // 1001 in binary
int z=x^y;

/*
x = 0101
y = 1001
--------- XOR
z = 1100 = 12 in decimal
*/
```

You may seen a neat trick to swap two integers using XOR.
It uses XOR's property to achieve so.

```cpp
int a=3;
int b=5;

a=a^b; // a=6, b=5
b=a^b; // a=6, b=3
a=a^b; // a=5, b=3
```

## A Sample Problem

> Refer to this [Kattis problem](https://open.kattis.com/problems/rationalsequence2).

### Problem Statement

**Abridged problem statement**: Given an infinite binary tree; each node consists of a fraction with numerator $p$ and a denominator $q$. The left child node is equal to $\frac{p}{p+q}$, and the right child node is equal to $\frac{p+q}{q}$. A function $F(n)$ is defined such that it will return the fraction from the respecting node. The nodes is numbered as depicted in the illustration taken from the problem below:

  <figcaption>Kattis Problem Illustration. (Source: <a href="https://open.kattis.com/problems/rationalsequence2">Kattis Rational Sequence 2</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

In the illustration above, the root node starts from the value of $p=1$ and $q=1$. This means that $F(1)=\frac{1}{1}$, $F(2)=\frac{1}{2}$, $F(3)=\frac{2}{1}$, etc. Given $p$ and $q$, we are required to return the value of $N$ of which $F(n)$ corresponds to $\frac{p}{q}$.

At a glance, this problem may not represent anything related to bit manipulation. If you look closer, it actually has two states - going to the left or right node (because of binary tree)! Before I give you my perspective on this problem, you may want to try and solve it for yourself ðŸ˜€

### Insights

The problem may suggest you to use breadth first search (BFS) method, by using a queue. 
For a fraction that lies in a small N, this would be viable. 
However, we donâ€™t know where the inputted fraction would lie, as this is an infinite binary tree.

So, how can we solve the problem? Hereâ€™s my thought process:

- It is (somehow) better to find directly from each testcase compared to pruning, as it would take too much time and memory.
- We can represent each node with its binary form.
- $p < q$ in the left nodes, whilst $p > q$ in the right nodes.

> **Q**: What does it mean by using its binary form?

Well, letâ€™s take the first, second, and third node in their binary form (`1`, `10`, `11`). Analyzing the pattern, we can first assume that in the left nodes we append a `0` from the first node, and in the right nodes we append a `1` from the first node.

> **Q**: Why does it work?

*Simple* â€” It is a **binary tree**! Well of course the N would follow the pattern of binary digits!

Because weâ€™re solving the problem from by top-down, we need to append digits (if left `0`, if right `1`) from the front. How do we achieve such result? We use the OR operator with the shift left operator to turn on a bit in specified location.

```cpp
int result=0; // 000
int pos=2;
result|=(1<<pos); //turning on the 2nd bit from the right (0-based)

/*
(1<<pos) = 1 << 2 = 100 (in binary)
result = 000

000
100
---- OR
100
*/
```

This is my solution written in C++:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {

  int t;
  scanf("%d", &t);

  while (t--) {
    int k;
    int p, q;
    scanf("%d %d/%d", &k, &p, &q);

    int res = 0, cnt = 0;
    while (!(p == 1 && q == 1)) {
      int tp, tq;
      if (p > q) //right
      {
        tp = p - q;
        tq = q;
        res |= (1 << cnt);
      } else //left
      {
        tp = p;
        tq = q - p;
      }
      cnt++;
      p = tp;
      q = tq;
    }

    res |= (1 << cnt);
    printf("%d %d\n", k, res);
  }
}
```

Note that because we start from the index of one, we append another 1 after we reach the initial node.

This solution, because we traverse up a binary tree, it makes the time complexity of the program of $O(\log{n})$.

## Conclusion

This problem sample is just one of the usage of bit manipulation. 
Some other applications are also interesting in programming includes:
- Storing boolean values in `bitset`
- Reverse Backtracking by using Bitmasks
- Dynamic Programming with Bitmasks
- etc.

I hope this guide can be a good start to understand bit manipulation techniques, or enrich the readers with more knowledge.

Thank you for reading and happy learning ðŸ˜€
