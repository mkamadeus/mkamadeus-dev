# Terminologies

Here are some terminologies in this book:

- **ML**: Short for "Machine Learning"
- **MLOPs**: A set of tools and practices to ensure ML delivery into production.

# When to use Machine Learning?

> Recaping the important points.

Here are some points as guideline of when to use machine learning in a problem.

1. System needs to be able to learn
2. System needs to understand complex patterns in the problem
3. Abudance of data in the problem domain
4. Problem requires prediction/estimation of values
5. Unseen data/input holds true to the whole data population
6. Input and output are repetitive
7. Wrong predictions are tolerable
8. Problem on a relatively large scale
9. Patterns are changing frequently
